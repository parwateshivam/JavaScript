**JavaScript Conditionals – Summary**

JavaScript conditionals are statements that allow code to make decisions and execute different actions based on certain conditions (true/false). They help control the program’s flow.

**Types of Conditionals:**

1. **`if` statement** – Runs a block of code if a condition is `true`.

   if (age >= 18) {
       console.log("You can vote.");
   }

2. **`if...else` statement** – Provides an alternative block of code if the condition is `false`.

   ```javascript
   if (score >= 50) {
       console.log("Pass");
   } else {
       console.log("Fail");
   }
   ```

3. **`if...else if...else` statement** – Checks multiple conditions in sequence.

   ```javascript
   if (marks >= 90) {
       console.log("A");
   } else if (marks >= 75) {
       console.log("B");
   } else {
       console.log("C");
   }
   ```

4. **`switch` statement** – Compares a value against multiple cases for cleaner multi-choice logic.

   ```javascript
   switch (day) {
       case "Monday":
           console.log("Start of the week");
           break;
       case "Friday":
           console.log("Weekend is near");
           break;
       default:
           console.log("Midweek");
   }
   ```

5. **Ternary operator (`condition ? value1 : value2`)** – Short form for simple `if...else`.

   ```javascript
   let result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
   ```

**Key Points:**

* Conditions use comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) and logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
* `===` is strict equality (checks both value and type), while `==` does type conversion before comparison.
* Always ensure proper `break` usage in `switch` to prevent *fall-through* unless intentional.
